# Overview
In this day and age, there are millions of applications that have been created and are widely used. 
A developerâ€™s ability to read and understand code is even more important than their ability to write 
code. As such, I was given a an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Application and I enhanced and improved it.

I enhanced and improved the application by applying architectural patterns to it, while also keeping 
to the SOLID principles as best as I could.

# Using the Application:
## The Home page

When accessed, the landing page will look like this, and a new user will have to create an account.
The next step is to click on the Register button.

## Registering an account
